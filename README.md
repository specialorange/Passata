# Passata
Tomato Sauce

This is to help large scale passata makers plan and execute making the sauce :)

Best tips that are hard to find on the interwebs:

  - ~35lb makes ~7 qts of sauce
  - simmer the sauce first to get rid of as much water as possible to reduce simmer times later
  - salt at the end, so it doesnt concetrate the saltiness as the process goes through
